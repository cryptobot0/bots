## Digital Identity Platform

Tradle has created an identity platform on blockchain. Blockchain allowed us to create a self-sovereign identity that is owned by you, not by any institution or the government. We have used this identity platform to then build a Know Your Customer (KYC) product, which we are successfully selling to the biggest banks and insurance companies in the world. 

And now the fintechs, insureTechs and mature financial institutions launch digital products in this highly regulated market much faster.

Identity is at the core of all applications, and an identity that no one owns but you yourself is essential in today's world. It took us 3 years of blood and sweat to build, making sure it is good for us, as citizens, for the businesses, multinationals, and their service providers, financial institutions, and that the governments will be able to accept it too. 

Tradle is working with several regulators in official programs, and is in discussions with about 15. We have found a formula for the full anonymity of your identity on blockchain, yet giving law enforcement an ability to request to repeal some parts of your anonymity in a lawful way, without resorting to mass surveilance. There is much to be said on the topic of identity, and we have a lot of materials on the subject to share with you. This paragragraph is a temporary stub, which will soon be expanded. 

## What the bot is this?

[Apps are dying, long live bots](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/here-come-the-bots). 
Bots provide a universal conversational UI, where new type of apps (called bots) are built on the server side, like we used to do with the Web apps.

Tradle's blockchain-based bot framework provides the Tradle app on iOS, Android and Web, so that you can build apps / bots really really fast. Why another bot framework? Why blockchain? Want to skip intro? See [ideas of the kind of bots you can build today](https://github.com/tradle/bots/blob/master/docs/bots.md).

Tradle offers forms, not just texting. Forms are powerful, in 1995 they made the browser a universal interface for building apps. Devs define new forms with data models in json format. More on that later. 

The Tradle server seals the data exchanged via the forms onto the blockchain. This way any agreement, order, or other commercial or governmental transaction can be proven to have taken place. This allows to build powerful applications that work across many web sites. It allows to decentralize identities, marketplaces, governments, most everything, including the app stores, controlled today by two powerful corporations. Blockchain was called by the Economist, [the Trust Machine](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21677198-technology-behind-bitcoin-could-transform-how-economy-works-trust-machine). The Economist said that the blockchain will redefine how economy works, defy corruption, fight monopolies, and help us build a better world. No wonder over [billion dollars has been invested into blockchain startups](https://news.bitcoin.com/1-4-billion-invested-blockchain-pwc/).

The tectonic shift has started. It is up to you to make a difference. And Tradle is here to help.

Tradle has used the blockchain, forms and the bot interface to build a powerful global identity system, and is now selling its variant called KYC (know your customer) to 40 of the biggest financial institutions in the world. A startup like yours, we graduated from Startupbootcamp Fintech program in London at the end of 2015, and have won many awards since then. With Tier 1 multinationals buying it, [regulators supporting it](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/financial-conduct-authority-unveils-successful-sandbox-firms-second-anniversary), we finally can open this as a framework for you.
