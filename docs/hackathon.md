You made it! 

Before you hit the README, head on over to [https://bots.tradle.io](https://bots.tradle.io), where we have a Tradle web app set up with a bunch of test bots, some of which are built with this framework. Register, click `Conversations` in the Profile page footer, and talk to the Inviter bot, so we can send you an invite to the mobile app.
